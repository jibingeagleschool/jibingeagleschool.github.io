                    I am returning to college after intially starting at the University of California Riverside way back
                    in the fall of 1996. With mulitiple attempts in various schools since that time I will finally
                    complete my degree at the end of this semester and start a second career. I recently retired from
                    the US Navy Submarine Force with more than 24 years of service onboard submarines such as the USS
                    Virginia, USS Jimmy Carter and USS MIssouri. While in the Navy I have had the opportunity to be
                    stationed in Groton Connecticut, Bangor Washington, Yokusoka Japan, and Pearl Harbor Hawaii
